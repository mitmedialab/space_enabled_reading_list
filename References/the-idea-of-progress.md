## Key Ideas
#key-idea:: While the opinion of society about technology has gone through cycles of optimism and pessism since the start of the Industrial Revolution and critiques of technological progress date back to at least Rousseau, the idea that technological, economic, and moral progress are both inevitable and inextricably linked has remained persistant, particularly among the scientists and engineers who were most directly involved with the development of technology.
