## Key Ideas
#key-idea:: **Technicist:** Planning focused on maximizing efficient of the system being planned. The planner is a technical professional with specialized knowledge. The "technicist is inherently conservative: it is to serve an economic and social and policital order in which its role is to make that order function smoothly.""
#key-idea:: **Social Reform:** Planning grounded in social ideas and values while viewing the necessary changes as possible within the exisiting framework of social, political, and economic order. The exact values of concern have varied over the years, with environmental sustainability coming to the rise more recently.
#key-idea::  **Social Justice:** Planning by grass-roots groups and social movements, putting values ahead of efficiency, and willing to work outside of existing systems to accomplish its goals.**
