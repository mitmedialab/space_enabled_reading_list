## Abstract
This article will critically examine four major types of argument that have been used as two-edged rhetorical swords both to criticize and defend government planning efforts and to consider the implications of these arguments for planning in the 1980s and beyond. The analysis will consider only formal governmental efforts at the local and regional level lo achieve desired goals and solve novel problems in complex contexts, or what in Britain is called "town and country planning" and in America "city and regional planning."  As a result, the arguments considered below are not necessarily applicable lo national economic planning or to the planning done by private individuals and organizations. Also not considered are the legal arguments for planning in particular constitutional or common-law contexts or arguments such as Mannheim's, which have had little effect on the contemporary political debate.
