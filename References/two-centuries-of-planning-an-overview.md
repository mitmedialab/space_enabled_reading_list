## Abstract

What is this thing called planning? What is its domain? What do planners do? How do they talk? What are the limits and possibilities for planning imposed by power, politics, knowledge, technology, interpretation, ethics, and institutional design? In this comprehensive volume, the foremost voices in planning explore the foundational ideas and issues of the profession.Explorations in Planning Theory is an extended inquiry into the practice of the profession. As such, it is a landmark text that defines the field for today's planners and the next generation. As Seymour J. Mandelbaum notes in the introduction, ""the shared framework of these essays captures a pervasive interest in the behavior, values, character, and experience of professional planners at work.""All of the chapters in this volume are written to address arguments that are important in the community of planning theoreticians and are crafted in the language of that community. While many of the contributors included here differ in their styles, the editors note that students, experienced practitioners, and scholars of city and regional planning will find this work illuminating and helpful in their research.


## Key Ideas
#key-idea::  Good overview of major schools of thought within development. In the below timeline, further to the left indicates more conservative/technical; center indicates social reformist; far right indicates utopian/anarchistic.
#key-idea::  Systems engineering is positioned on the far left of the figure, indicating that the field (or at least the authors listed associated with it) "look to the confirmation and reproduction of existing relationships of power in society. Expressing predominantly technical concerns, they proclaim a carefully nurtured stance of political nuetrality. In reality, they address their work to those who are in power and see their primary mission as serving the state."

## Quotes
"The engineer's sense of certainty (and his ignorance of history) informed some of the most prominent of later planning theorists... all of whom were enthralled by the idea of 'designing society'"
"There was a moment in time when aeronautic and space engineers throught that, having reached the moon, they could now turn their energies to solving the problem of growing violence in cities along with other urban "crises."
