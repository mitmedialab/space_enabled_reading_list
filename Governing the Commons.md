Ostrom, Elinor. *Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action*. Reissue edition, Cambridge University Press, 1990.

 Book that would lead Ostrom to win the Nobel Prize. In addition to the two classic ways of managing common pool resources (CPR), central management and privatization, this book proposes a third way: self-management. Lays out certain design principles for long-lasting self-management institutions:
 
 1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions
3. Collective-choice arrangements
4. Monitoring
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict-resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. (For CPRS that are parts of larger systems) Nested enterprises


"Relying on metaphors as the foundation for policy advice can lead to results substantially different from those presumed to be likely... One can get trapped in one's own intellectual web. When years have been spent in the development of a theory with considerable power and elegance, analysts obviously will want to apply this tool to as many situations as possible... Confusing a model with the theory of which it is one representation can limit applicability still further"
