# Advancing Justice and Development

This portion of the reading list is continuing to evolve. It includes anti-racist thought leaders, development scholars and examples of community development leaders who have identified effective approaches to advancing justice locally and globally. I expect to add additional readings on justice in the context of global trade, migration, workersâ€™ rights and human trafficking.

## Development

### General Development Theory

### International Development

### Sustainable Development

### Innovation Theory

## Justice & Anti-Racist Thought

### Race & Colonialism

### Big Data, Algorithms, & Surveillance Capitalism

### Design Justice
