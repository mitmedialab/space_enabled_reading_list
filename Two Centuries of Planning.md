Friedmann, Johnn. “Two Centuries of Planning: An Overview.” Explorations in Planning Theory, edited by Seymour Mandelbaum et al., Routledge, 2017, pp. 10–29.

  Good overview of major schools of thought within development. In the below timeline, further to the left indicates more conservative/technical; center indicates social reformist; far right indicates utopian/anarchistic.

 Systems engineering is positioned on the far left of the figure, indicating that the field (or at least the authors listed associated with it) "look to the confirmation and reproduction of existing relationships of power in society. Expressing predominantly technical concerns, they proclaim a carefully nurtured stance of political nuetrality. In reality, they address their work to those who are in power and see their primary mission as serving the state."
 
"The engineer's sense of certainty (and his ignorance of history) informed some of the most prominent of later planning theorists... all of whom were enthralled by the idea of 'designing society'"

"There was a moment in time when aeronautic and space engineers throught that, having reached the moon, they could now turn their energies to solving the problem of growing violence in cities along with other urban "crises."
