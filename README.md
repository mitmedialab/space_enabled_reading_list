# Space Enabled Reading List

## Welcome! 
The mission of the Space Enabled Research Group at the MIT Media Lab is “advancing justice in Earth’s complex systems using designs enabled by space.” The readings contained in this repository inform the research direction and theoretical foundations of the Space Enabled Research Group. The readings are divided into categories that reflect the mission statement of the group, but the unique contribution of the group will be to integrate the thinking of these readings into a coherent call to action.

### The field tag
The field tag, #field , is one of the main heirachies in this repository. It is organized around three components of the Space Enabled mission. Obviously many references cut across multiple fields or mission components, so you may very well see articles with multiple field tags.  Here is the general organization of this tag:

1. Advancing Justice and Development #field/advancing_justice 
	1. Development #field/advancing_justice/development 
		1. General Development Theory #field/advancing_justice/development/theory 
		2. International Development #field/advancing_justice/development/international
		3. Sustainable Development #field/advancing_justice/development/sustainable
