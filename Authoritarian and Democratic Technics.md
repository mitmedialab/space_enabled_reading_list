Mumford, Lewis. “Authoritarian and Democratic Technics.” *Technology and Culture*, vol. 5, no. 1, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Society for the History of Technology, 1964, pp. 1–8. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/3101118.

  

Mumford theorized that technology came in two different essential stripes, neither good or evil, but instead authoritarian and democratic, that "from late neolithic times in the Near East, right down to our own day, two technologies have recurrently existed side by side: one authoritarian, hte other democratic, the first system-centered, immensely powerful, but inherently unstable, athe other [hu]man-centered, relatively weak, but resourceful and durable"
