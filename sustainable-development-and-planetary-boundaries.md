## Abstract

The concept of planetary boundaries has been developed to outline a safe operating space for humanity that carries a low likelihood of harming the life support systems on Earth to such an extent that they no longer are able to support economic growth and human development. As this paper explains, planetary boundaries do not place a cap on human development. Instead they provide a safe space for innovation, growth and development in the pursuit of human prosperity in an increasingly populated and wealthy world.
