Winner, Langdon. “Do Artifacts Have Politics?” *Daedalus*, vol. 109, no. 1, The MIT Press, 1980, pp. 121–36.


Winner argued that many technologies had politics embedded in them, regardless of the intent of either the creater or use. "It is neither correct nor insightful to say, 'Someone intended to do somebody else harm.' Rather, one must say that the technological deck has been stacked long in advance to favor certain social interests, and that some people were bound to receive a better hand than others"

Winner very much builds upon the earlier work of Langdon
